If it's a large snake like a King Cobra, give it space. These snakes are intelligent, and they don’t want to bite. Slowly, deliberately, back away. Don't make any sudden movements. 

If you’re dealing with a sea snake, like the *Pelamis platurus*, understand it’s a highly defensive creature. Keep your distance and move slowly.
